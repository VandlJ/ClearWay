## How to run unit tests?

- first of all, make sure you have installed framework `jest`
- if not, you can install it via `npm i jest --save-dev`
  - This framework is only dev dependency - we need him only during testing, not during the application deployment, it would be useless and take a space
- after that, run command `npm run test` - it will automatically execute all tests (currently in folder `utils`)
